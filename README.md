Keywords: Residual Analysis, Dummy variables and goodness of fit tests

[Problem 1]A university career center collects information on the job status and starting salary of graduating seniors. Data recently collected over a two-year period included over 900 seniors who had found employment at the time of graduation. The information was used to model starting salary Y as a function of two qualitative independent variables: COLLEGE at four levels {Business, Engineering, Liberal Arts, Nursing} and SEX (male and female). 
a)	Define the dummy variables to include college (use Business as your baseline) in a regression model for starting salary Y
b)	Write down the general regression model relating starting salary Y to both college and sex.  
c)  How would your model change if students in Engineering have the same starting salary as students in Business?

[Problem 2] Using the banking.txt dataset:
a)	Analyze the residuals of the regression model you found in your previous assignment. 
b)	Conduct a global F-test for overall model adequacy. Write down the test hypotheses and test statistic and discuss conclusions.


[Problem 3] A national homebuilder builds single-family homes and condominium style townhouses.   
The file housesales.txt provides information on the selling price (PRICE), lot cost (COST), type of home (HOME) (SF=single family home or T=condominium style) and region of the country (REGION) (M=Midwest, S=south) for closings during one month.  

a)	Define the dummy variables for region and home, and create them in R.
b)	Analyze the association between selling price and each individual attribute (cost, home and region) using appropriate statistics and graphs. Discuss your findings.
c)	Fit an adequate regression model for sales price as a function of lot cost, region of country, and type of home. Remove the terms that are not significant. The final model should only contain variables that are significantly associated with sale price.  Specify the model.
d)	Conduct goodness of fit test for the selected regression model.
e)	Analyze model residuals to check if assumptions on data are satisfied. Discuss your findings.
f)	Discuss what the regression model indicates for the relationship between price and home type.
g)	Use the regression analysis to determine whether mean sale prices are different for the two regions? Explain.
