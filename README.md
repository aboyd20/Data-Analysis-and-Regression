# Data Analysis and Regression
Keywords: Residual Analysis, Dummy variables and goodness of fit tests

A university career center collects information on the job status and starting salary of graduating seniors. Data recently collected over a two-year period included over 900 seniors who had found employment at the time of graduation. The information was used to model starting salary Y as a function of two qualitative independent variables: COLLEGE at four levels {Business, Engineering, Liberal Arts, Nursing} and SEX (male and female). 
1.	Define the dummy variables to include college (use Business as your baseline) in a regression model for starting salary Y
2.	Write down the general regression model relating starting salary Y to both college and sex.  
3.	How would your model change if students in Engineering have the same starting salary as students in Business?
